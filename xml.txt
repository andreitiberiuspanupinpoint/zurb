<div id="one"><h2>HTML 5</h2><p>The very first step in my journey of becoming a web developer. From doctype declaration up to new semantic and multimedia elements.</p></div>
<div id="two"><h2>CSS / CSS3</h2><p>Excellent! where would the style go? from regular to new features as transforamations and animations. But never inline.</p></div>
<div id="three"><h2>Javascript</h2><p>I just love to see how Javascript takes control over the DOM. ECMAScript 5 is the name of the game.</p></div>
<div id="four"><h2>jQuery</h2><p>From sliders to counters, from page elements animations to front validation, just like Javascript only more fun.</p></div>
<div id="five"><h2>Adobe Suite</h2><p>Ps, Ai, Fw, Fl, Dw. Yes! Every day, every time! A must have in the suitcase of skills.</p></div>
<div id="six"><h2>Responsive Design</h2><p>Fixed layout is obsolete. With all the new mobile devices and screen sizes, responsive design is the key.</p></div>
<div id="seven"><h2>MySQL</h2><p>The most widely used open-source Database Management System. Since my designs became more complex, I needed this upgrade.</p></div>
<div id="eight"><h2>PHP</h2><p>Now a brand new chapter opened: dynamic websites, database queries, server-side validations, user acces, sessions and many more.</p></div>
<div id="nine"><h2>Ajax</h2><p>Works with the server and PHP to deliver fast, dynamic content.</p></div>
