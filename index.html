	      		<p>I consider myself to be an explorer opened to new challenges, fit for the ever changing technological and social landscape of today. Programming, for me, transformed from a hobby to a lifestyle and then turned into a fruitful career. Who I am is the end result of many hours, days, months of continuous preparation, testing and learning.<br />
				The future is bright because I still have the same firmness of purpose to succeed, to upgrade my skills and to improve as an individual. I feel every day the same joy as when I wrote my first "Hello World!".<br />
				The programming languages gradually add up like an puzzle of electronic knowledge, every single one allowing for deeper understanding of the mysterious analytical world. Programming is art, science and determination, all in one place, under a very rewarding and highly addictive form. It defines my personality.<br />
				For each and every step forward I have rewarded myself a star :</p>
